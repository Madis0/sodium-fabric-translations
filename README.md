## Overview

## Translating

**By submitting translations, you are agreeing to have them licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license.**

You can contribute to the translation effort on our Crowdin [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric)! First you'll need to [register](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register) a Crowdin account if you haven't already. Translators are able to **translate** (submit a translation for an untranslated phrase), **suggest** (propose a better translation compared to an existing one), or **vote** (vote up or down the quality of a translation).

For more information on using Crowdin, please see their "[Intro For Volunteer Translators](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/)" support page.

## FAQ

### Current translation is wrong or I don't know how to translate it!

Please [open an issue on the phrase](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/#reporting-issues).

### My language is not listed!

Please [request it on Crowdin Discussions](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric/discussions).

### Will you translate Sodium into minority or fictional languages?

Currently this project will not include fictional (e.g. Esperanto), "joke" (e.g. LOLCAT) or minority languages (speakers less than 1 million or insufficient translations in [official Minecraft project](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft)). The reason is simple - these languages are easy to abuse and hard to proofread.
