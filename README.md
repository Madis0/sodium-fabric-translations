This repository hosts unofficial translations for [**Sodium**](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric), a Minecraft mod designed to improve frame rates and reduce micro-stutter. Please see [the FAQ](#FAQ) for **F**requently **A**sked **Q**uestions and supplimentary information about the project.

## Installation

All translations in this repository are available as a resource pack, which you can install like any other resource pack. Simply grab the latest release and put it into your resource pack folder. You can find the latest release here: [Download latest release](https://github.com/Madis0/sodium-fabric-translations/releases/latest/download/Sodium.Translations.zip).

Please note that it might take a while for changes to be synced to this repository. If you don't see the most recent translations, please check back later for a new release.

## Translating

**By submitting translations, you are agreeing to have them licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) license.**

You can contribute to the translation effort on our Crowdin [project page](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric)! First you'll need to [register](https://accounts.crowdin.com/register) a Crowdin account if you haven't already. Translators are able to **translate** (submit a translation for an untranslated phrase), **suggest** (propose a better translation compared to an existing one), or **vote** (vote up or down the quality of a translation).

For more information on using Crowdin, please see their "[Intro For Volunteer Translators](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/)" support page.

## FAQ

### Can I include this in my CurseForge/Modrinth/packwiz/whatever modpack?

Yes! Everyone can do it, don't need any special permission.

### Current translation is wrong or I don't know how to translate it

Please [open an issue on the phrase](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/#reporting-issues).

### My language is not listed or I want to become a proofreader

Please [request it on Crowdin Discussions](https://crowdin.com/project/sodium-fabric/discussions).

#### Will you translate Sodium into minority or fictional languages?

Currently this project will not include fictional (e.g. Esperanto), "joke" (e.g. LOLCAT) or minority languages (speakers less than 1 million or insufficient translations in [official Minecraft project](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft)). The reason is simple - these languages are easy to abuse and hard to proofread.

### Where can I find the original language file?

At the moment, [1.19.4/stable branch en_us.json](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/blob/1.19.4/stable/src/main/resources/assets/sodium/lang/en_us.json) is used. Some strings may be appended from the equivalent dev branch file.
